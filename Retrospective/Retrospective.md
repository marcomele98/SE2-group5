TEMPLATE FOR RETROSPECTIVE (Team 5)
=====================================

The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs. done : (4, 4)
- Total points committed vs. done : (8, 8)
- Nr of hours planned vs. spent (as a team) : (48h 30m, 47h 50m)

**Remember** a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:
 
- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

> Please refine your DoD if required (you cannot remove items!) 

### Detailed statistics
1) Database creation, learning task and planning tasks.
2) As a client i want tospecify the service that i need so that I can be inserted in a queue.
3) As a client i want to know the waiting time
4) As a client i what to get a notification
5) As an officer i want to call the next client

| Story  | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|--------------|
| 0      | 7       |  -     |  32h       |   30h 15m    |
| 1      | 4       |  2     |  4h 30m    |   4h 55m     |
| 2      | 4       |  2     |  6h 30m    |   6h 20m     |
| 3      | 2       |  1     |  1h        |   45m        |
| 4      | 4       |  3     |  4h 30m    |   5h 35m     |


- Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual)
  - Estimated task average: (48h 30m/21) = 2h 20m 
  - Actual task average: (47h 50m/21) = 2h 15m
  - Estimated standard deviation: 3.134
  - Actual standard deviation: 3.406
  
  <br>
- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent - 1: (1,01 - 1) = 0.01

  
## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 4h 
  - Total hours spent: 3h
  - Nr of automated unit test cases 3
  - Coverage (if available)
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 3h 30m
  - Total hours spent: 2h 15m
- Code review 
  - Total hours estimated: 1h 30m
  - Total hours spent: 45m
  


## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?

    We underestimated the implementation so we almost finished our time before testing and we have not considered some tasks for example for do the merge of all branches. 
  <br>
- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

    We have to define a structure of the application and of the database and all of us have to follow it in order to avoid conflicts and produce a coherent software. We have also to estimate better the time that we need to implement a story and we have to start from the most important story and complete it before doing others.
  <br>

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve?
  <br>

- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?
  <br>

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)

    Define a structure of the application and of the database and all of us have to follow it in order to avoid conflicts and produce a coherent software. Better comunication and more scrum meetings.
  <br>
- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!

    Despite all the difficulties we encountered everyone help each other so we were able to deliver what we planned to deliver.
